Code 1 generates the main dataframe containing the results of the sensitivity analysis, i.e.
body temperature and thermal performance as a function of different values of body mass,
skin absorbance to shortwave radiation, preferred temperature, thermoregulatory ability, 
and critical thermal limits (CTmax and CTmin)

Code 2 generates uses the dataframe generated in Code 1 to compute the sensitivity of thermal performance 
to variations in body mass,skin absorbance to shortwave radiation, preferred temperature, thermoregulatory ability, 
and critical thermal limits (CTmax and CTmin).
